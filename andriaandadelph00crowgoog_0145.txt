not only to minor differencea of name and incident, hut to a new ocn-
oepticn in some instanoes of the plote ol his plays and the characters
he was reprodncing. Availing himself ol' the whole οἰ the Menandrian
repertory‚ be worked up the old materiale into a new and consistent
creation. Tha number ol fragmenta of unasoertained playa of Me-
nander which lit more or losa closely with Terence, many oi them
quite aa wall aa those passages directly quoted from the corresponding
playa οἰ Menander, loads us to the conclusion that Terence drew not
only t'rom tha single play which ha had before him, bnt also from hia
general knowledge oi the works ol' Menander and tha other authors
of Greek comedy.”

His excellence in the delineation of character hac also been generally
admitted. Varro'a ludgment was: In etheria Terentius peceat palmum.
“A close study,'’ says Parry, “will verify that both in the grouping
and the treatment of bis charactera, Terence is an originales com-
pared with Plautus3 and from the hints we can glean from the aoattared
fragments ol the Greek comedians, we may conclude that he was in a
great measure original, even when compared with Menander.’' And
Mommsen remarks that “while Plautus painta his charactera with broad
chokes, often aster a stcck model, Terence handles the psychological

, development with a careiul anderten excellent miniature painting.”
The complaint has sometimes bean made that Terence was deficient
in comio soree, and that he lacked the livelinesa, stenhusen, and versa·
tility of Plautus. Mommsen's language ia that ‘he reproduced the
agreeableness without the merriment of Menander.' And in support
os this allegation the famous epigram oi Caesar, preserved by Sue·

tonius, hasbeen often quoted:

Lenibus atquc utinam scriptia adiuncta feretrato,
Oomicu ut aequato uirtus polleret honore

Cum Graecia, neque in lae despectus parte iaceres:
Vnum boo πηοεν-ον et doleo tibi deesse, Terenti.

But it must always ba remembered that Terence's playa ara ‘ comedias
of sentiment,' in which the via comica has a subordinate placo, and the
distinguishing characteristica of which ara humor and pathos. In
these qualities he has been considered by scholare best qualibed to pro-
nounce an opinion, not deficient by tho side oi Menander. The oon-
clusion ef the writer in Smith’s Dictioncry, in his comparison of the
two comedians, ie: “ Granting to Plautus the highest genius forexciting
laughter, the eloquence Aelius Stilo ascribed te him, and a natural
,ι toros-cirtae-which Terence wanted, there will remain to the latter ,
