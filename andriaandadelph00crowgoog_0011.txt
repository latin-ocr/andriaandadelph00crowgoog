the numbering, will not, it 10 believed, detract at all from Ι

their valne or interest to the student.

The principal object in the Notes has been to aid the
pupil in understanding the forms, meanings, and con·
structione of words peculiar to Terence or to his age, and
the numerous elliptical colloquial expressions that occur,
as well as to explain the plot of each play. In their
preparation, use has been made chiefly of the commen·
taries of Wilhelm Wagner, Cambridge, Eng, 1869, Ε.
St. J. Parry in the ,Bibliotheca 01000100, London, 1857,
Reinhold Klotz (The Andria), Leipsio‚ 1865, J. A. Phil·
lips, Dnblin, 1846, and occasionally of the older works
, 01 Klotz (1838), Stallbaum, and Westerhovius, which
0100 contain the commentarios of the ancient gram·
mariana Donatus and Eugraphins.

A brief account 01 Terence and his writings has been
prefixed 10 1100 Notae, and an Appendix added upon the
prosody and metrea, with the metrical key to the Andria
and Adelpboe. 1

No American edition of Terence has been published
since that 01 Dillaway in 1839. Itis therefore hoped‚
with the more confidence, that this edition may be 01
service to the pupil in his study 01 the language in the
earlier period of its history, and may contributa to the
better appreciation 01 00 author who, in purity of idiom
and elegance of style, was not surpassed by Cicero οο
Caesar, and whose plays are among the finest specimens
01 Roman comedy extant.
