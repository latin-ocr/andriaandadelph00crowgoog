iether's drst suspicion ol Pamphilus' opposition to this wes ewahened
by observing his conduct at Chrysis'iunere13 while Chremes, on learn-
ing the whole story oi Pamphilus’ connection with her, brohe oli the
match.

The action oi the play begins at this point. Simo announces to
Pamphilus that he must marry Philumena et once, hoping thet ii he
consents Chremes may be reconoiled. This brings Pamphilus into
great perplexity. But Davus, finding on investigetion that the mer-
riege is e pretence, advises Pamphilus to humor his iether 1)] profess-
ing to consent, end to keep up the suspicions oi Chremes by his
intimacy with Glycerium. Meanwhile, Charinus, eiriend oi Pamphilus
end lover ol Philumena, has heard ol his proposed marriage to her,
end urges him to deler it, il possible. ⁵

Just et this time, Simo, again negotiating with chremes, secures his
essent, and Chesinos is new angry et the supposed treachery oi Pam-
philus, while Davus is reproached by his master lor his untoward
advice. Ae e lest resort, he brings about ou interview between Chremes
and Mysis, whose story of Glycerium end her child occasions ageio e

Andros end next of kin to Chrysis, arrives, who cleers up the history
of Glycerium. She is recognized as Chremes’ daughter, end his oon-
seut, with that ef Simo, Pamphilus then obtains for their marriage.

without doubt, aveiled themselves of the colementarii magistratuum, in
which au accurate account was kept of all exhibitione made by the
