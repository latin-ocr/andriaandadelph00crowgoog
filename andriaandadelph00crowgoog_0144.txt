well defy any oritis to show where Terence left off and his friends ,
began.'' The story ean he explained by the faot of literaryjealousy‚
the hostility of the conservative faetion iu literature led hy Coto and
the Fabii to every prominent writer in the opposite party, and, per-
haps, in psrt also, by the strong prejudioes of the Romans against
freedmen and foreigners, whioh even Horaoe experieuoed. In his
alluvione to this aeousation in the prologues of the Hooton timoromenoa
(l. 22-25), and of the Adelphos (l. 15-21), Tereuoe does not indeed
' deuy it, in the former leaving the question of its truth to the judgmeut
of his hearers, aud in the latter insisting that if it were true, he ought
to feel proud of it rather than ashamed3 but his evasiou of the oberge
ean he aooouutod for on the ground that it was impolitis for him to
deny that whieh would be so ereditahle, and therefore flatteriug‚ to his
patrous, while it would of oourse be readily admitted that he may have
read his plays to them, aud hare arailed himself of their oritieisms.
The names of Terenos’s semodios in the order in whioh they are
believed to have been written ares The Andria or Woman of Andros,
The Hecyra or Mother-iu-law, The Eaaaolus, The Haotou timoremv-
sos or Seli-Tormentor, The Phormio or Parasite, and the Adelpltoe or
Brothers. It has been the fashiou to oharge him with being a eopyist
iu the preparation of these playa, but this oharge has been pressed too
elosely. Eveu Mommsen admits that “hy the litersl adhereuoe of his

r ¹ imitations to the originale we ars not to understand s verbsl transla-

tion iu our seuse.'’ For these productione he did not indeed claim
originality iu the striot senso of that term. In eommon with all the
playwrights of his day, it was simply his aim to roproduoe iu Latin
the hest works of the Attio eomedy, or rather to oonstruot plays inde-

, pendentlyout of the oommon Greek materials. Four of them are

founded upon eomedies of Menander, the most eminent of the poeta of
tho N ew Comedy (whose works are not now extant), ami the other two
· upon eomedies of Apollodorus of Carystus in Euhoea; audhis indebted-
nass to these writers is distinotly aud fully aokuowledged iu his pro·
logues. He may, however,justly olaim the merit of great art and some
inventive power in the skill with whioh' he oomhiued two or more
Greek plays into one, and iu his treatment of his oharaoters. The
praetioe of contomisroting plays, ss it was oolled, was a eommou oue
with the early Roman poets, oud Terenos formed the plots of four of
his ploys iu this way. But in this work he was no mere oompiler.
Parry, who has oarefully examiued all the extant fragments of Me-
nander, expresses the opinion that ferenes ‘⁴ oauuot simply have dove·
tailed his new matter into the existiug plot, but must, to a great extent,
have reoast the whole. The Ιοιοιωι variatione from the original extend
