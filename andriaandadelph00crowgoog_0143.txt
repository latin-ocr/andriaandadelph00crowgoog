culture at the hands of Ennius, “the father and prince of Roman
poetry.” Eren the drama, in its earliest rude form of translations of
Greek plays hy Livius Andronicus, had its beginning only about half
a century before his birth, the first eminent tragedian, Pacuvius, was
his contemporary, and but three writers of comedy had preceded him
- On. Naevius, Plautus, and Caecilius Statius. 'so Caecilius, then at
the head of his profession, Terence was referred by the curule aediles,
on otl'ering his first play to them for exhibition, at the age of sixteen.
As the story ran, he began the reading of it seated near the table at
which the critio sud his friends were dining. Hc had not proceeded
far, when Caecilius, delighted with the character of the work, invited
him to join the party at the feast ς aud after it was over, the remaindcr
of tha play was read, highly approved by the audience, and recom-
mended to the aediles. Though it was not acted for two years, copies
of it were in circulation, and the author was very soon brought into
intimate friendship with Scipio Aemilianus and Laelius, young men
of about the mma age with himself, and already enthusiastio students
of Greek literature. Through them he also gained the acquaintance
of the Aemilii, the Metelli, the Scaevolae, and other learned and influ-
ential familias, as well as that of the prinoipal literary men. A rumor
soon started, and was circulated hy his rivals, that he was aided in the
composition of his plays by his patrous, anderen that they were the
real authors. Cicero (ud Art. VII. 3) and Quintilian (X. l, 100) state,
without, however, endorsing these reports, that they were generally
supposed to refer to Scipio and Laelius3 while Santra, a grammarian
and contemporary of Cicero, is quoted as remarking thetis the poet
had needed aid, he would not have applied to those noblemen, on ao-
count of their youth, but to such meu as Q. Fabius Labeo, Μ. Popillius
Lernaeos 1.. Sulpicius Galus, who were already distinguished lor their
learning. This entire supposition, however, is a mere conjecture, un-
supported by aparticle of proof. The argument against it, from
internal evidence, is thus stated by Parry: “A careful consideration
of Terenee’a plays leuda us to the conclusion that they are tho produc-
tion 'of a writer not only thoroughly educaterl, but having a consistent
theory of dramatio composition. Add to this the remarkable purity of
the languuge, and we cannot, without a violent inoonsistency, suppose
that this was the result of the patchwork contributione ol two or three
dilettanti noblemen. These plays are so even and consistent through·
out, individually and with oue another, having the same neatncas of
language, the same attention to metre, the same quiet tone of good-
natured humor and praotioal knowledge of the world, that we might
