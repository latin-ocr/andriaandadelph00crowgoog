INTRODUOTION.

Tua very little thetis known of the life oi Penarus Tenemus Anna
is obtained ohieily from an extraot from the De Poetis oi Suetonius,
preserved by the grammarian Aelius Donatus (fl. A. D. 350) in the
introduotion to his commentary on the eomedies oi this author.

According ιο this aooonnt, Terence was a nativa oi Carthago, aa
would also be inierred from his ooyuomea, and was brought to Rome a
aleva in his ohildhood, having been perhaps taken prisoner at some
inroad made by the Numidiana into Carthaginien territory. There he

lto, he died the next year, in Arcadia or Leucadia, of an illness oaused
by grief attha loss at sea oi a number of his translations of Greek
plays, or, nooording to another report, by shipwreolr on his return·
voyage to Italy. Hie brief life thus sell within the first hali oi the
seeond oentury B. 0., in the interval between the viotory oi the Romans
over Antiochus the Greai and their final struggle against Carthage—
tha period in whioh, by their ware against Perseus, the Ligariana,
Spaniards, and Sardiniens, they were eompleiing that oirouit of oon·
quest whioh brought ιο the State and ιο individual attinens vast wealtb,
hut in ite train politioal oorruption, a rapid deterioration oi morale, and
the deeline of the nation’s greatneas.

Thongh the Greek language had been generally well known sor a
oentury, and the Greek dramatists were popular at Rome as early as
the seoond Panlo war, there was no prose literature in Latin prior ιο

Terenoe's day, and the language had Just been reoeiving its first real
